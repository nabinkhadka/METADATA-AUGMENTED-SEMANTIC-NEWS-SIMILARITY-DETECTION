Bihar remains one of India’s most socially fragmented and economically deprived states. Around 88 percent of its population lives in rural areas, and the state continues to face deep structural inequality despite years of reform rhetoric.

Bihar remains one of India’s most socially fragmented and economically deprived states.

The social composition still shapes political outcomes: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) make up about 36 percent, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27 percent, and Scheduled Castes (SCs) nearly 20 percent of the population. The dominance of caste as a determinant of political loyalty remains, even as young voters show signs of gradual defiance of this traditional arithmetic.",world,politics

The election is being watched with intense curiosity not only across India but also in neighboring Nepal, whose politics often mirrors the social complexity and generational aspirations visible in Bihar.

Bihar remains one of India’s most socially fragmented and economically deprived states. Around 88 percent of its population lives in rural areas, and the state continues to face deep structural inequality despite years of reform rhetoric. The social composition still shapes political outcomes: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) make up about 36 percent, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27 percent, and Scheduled Castes (SCs) nearly 20 percent of the population. The dominance of caste as a determinant of political loyalty remains, even as young voters show signs of gradual defiance of this traditional arithmetic.",world,politics

Bihar remains one of India’s most socially fragmented and economically deprived states. Around 88 percent of its population lives in rural areas, and the state continues to face deep structural inequality despite years of reform rhetoric. The social composition still shapes political outcomes: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) make up about 36 percent, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27 percent, and Scheduled Castes (SCs) nearly 20 percent of the population.

Bihar remains one of India’s most socially fragmented and economically deprived states. Around 88 percent of its population lives in rural areas, and the state continues to face deep structural inequality despite years of reform rhetoric.

The dominance of caste as a determinant of political loyalty remains, even as young voters show signs of gradual defiance of this traditional arithmetic.",national,politics

Bihar remains one of India’s most socially fragmented and economically deprived states. Around 88 percent of its population lives in rural areas, and the state continues to face deep structural inequality despite years of reform rhetoric. The social composition still shapes political outcomes: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) make up about 36 percent, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27 percent, and Scheduled Castes (SCs) nearly 20 percent of the population. The dominance of caste as a determinant of political loyalty remains, even as young voters show signs of gradual defiance of this traditional arithmetic.",national,politics
